# AI_Project

## Objectives:

  * Create a number of machine learning models to predict housing prices
  * Train models to point of diminishing returns in terms of recall and precision scores
  * Collect prediction statistics for all models
  * Compare statistics and rank models based on predictions
  * Analyze outcomes and describe potential causes for each models perfomance
  
## Elements:

  * X number of unique ML models
  * Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/housing-prices-dataset
  * ML prediction statistics
