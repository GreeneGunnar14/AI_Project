# AI_Project

## Objectives:

  * Create a number of machine learning models to predict housing prices
  * Train models to point of diminishing returns in terms of recall and precision scores
  * Collect prediction statistics for all models
  * Compare statistics and rank models based on predictions
  * Analyze outcomes and describe potential causes for each model's perfomance
  
## Elements:

  * 5 unique models
  * Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/housing-prices-dataset
  * ML prediction statistics

## Note:

 * The files for individual models (decision_tree.py, kmeans.py, etc.) were used purely to test the process of setting each models. They will be left in the repository for the purpose of keeping some record of this process.
 * main.ipynb is the primary file for this lab, and contains examples and examinations of each model.
 * The vitrual environment 'aivenv' was not used for the final version of this lab as there were complications when using pip to install matplotlib
 
## Dependencies:

 * scikit-learn
 * numpy
 * pandas
 * matplotlib
 * tqdm
