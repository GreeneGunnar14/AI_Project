    "This lab will walk through how each model is set up and optimized. Metrics for each model will be compared in order to determine which model(s) would be most beneficial in a practical environment. The purpose of this lab is **not** to create a pseudo-state-of-the-art model which can predict prices with great accuracy, but rather to gain insight into which models have the most potential to perform this task.
